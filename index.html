                <p>
                 We created a platform (both web and mobile applications) that easily connects Pharmacies with patients and help people outsource hard to get medications. We also streamline the process of getting prescribed medicines to patients, by connecting them with pharmacies and other pharmacies nearby. This eliminates the need for patients to travel long distances or wait in long lines to get their medications. For pharmacies, our platform makes it easy for them to connect with other pharmacies and source hard-to-find or out-of-stock medications thereby helping our people access basic care and enables the pharmacies to provide a more comprehensive service to the public.
